# Magic_8_Ball

# Overview
This Application is Called Magic_8_Ball
This is a mobile application made with using Android Studio and the programming language Kotlin.
The goal of this project was to develop a fun a and simple add while taking advantage of muiliple
views. I wanted to make something that would be used atleast more than once. Which is where I got
the idea to create a magic 8 ball app.

Using an android device or the emulator, you will click the button to shake the 8 ball to get an answer to
your question and once an answer is given you are given the option to ask another question.

I would enjoy getting more into mobile development, as it is really popular nowadays and there is a lot of
opportunity there to be had.

# Development Environment

I used Kotlin, Android Studio, and photoshop to create this app.

I made separate views so the user wouldnt be stuck on one screen.

# Future Work

* Getting Better at analyzing how long an idea might take within a deadline.
* Get better and Java and other languages of interest.
* Continue development in my own personal projects, so I can continue to improve.
